Analog Input reader using a LDR(Light Dependent Resistor)/Photoresistor

A LDR is used as an analog input which is read by the Arduino. The voltage read by the board is then converted to a digital value using a ADC(Analog to Digital) Converter.

The digital value is then feeded to the LED which changes it's blink time w.r.t to the LDR as it changes its value when light intensity is decreased/increased.
